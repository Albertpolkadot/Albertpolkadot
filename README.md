- 👋 Hi, I’m @Albert, Head Ambassador of Polkadot in Spain
- 👀 I’m in the ecosystem from 2020 and as a normal user of Polkadot and I want to help the project with this vision. Sometime the projects build different Apps without consider de user experience and I want to help them with it. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programing fundamentals in "42 Barcelona".
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with differents projects who try to help Polkadot to improve their user experience.
